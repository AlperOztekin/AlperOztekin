# Project summary 
We are working at the drone factory. And we are trying to choose parts for drones. For every different drone we need different acceleration rates.
# Explanation of the project
To measure the acceleration rate of the drones we use MPU 9250 sensor and Arduino mega. And to do that we take data from the MPU 9250 with a arduino mega to the LabView with serial communication. At the LabView program measurements are done continuously and the measurements are shown on a panel and on a graph.
# Used Materials
- 1 Arduino Mega
- 1 MPU 9250
- 4 Female-Male jumper cables
